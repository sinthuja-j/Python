Happiness Score Calculation Program

üìù Overview

The Happiness Score Calculation Program analyzes tweets based on sentiment values tied to specific keywords. It calculates the 'happiness' score for different regions (Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Pacific) based on the presence of keywords in the tweets. The program utilizes sentiment values (ranging from 1 to 10) to compute the average sentiment for each region and provides a summary of the results.

The happiness score is derived through multiple calculations using user-provided files containing tweets and keywords with associated sentiment values.

üîë Key Features

Happiness Score Calculation: Computes a happiness score for tweets in each region based on sentiment values associated with keywords.
Region-based Analysis: Divides tweets into four U.S. regions (Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Pacific) based on geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude).
Keyword Sentiment: Utilizes keywords that are associated with sentiment values ranging from 1 to 10 to determine the overall sentiment of the tweets.
