⚡ Electricity Consumption Cost Calculator 🏠💰

Welcome to the Electricity Consumption Cost Calculator! This program calculates the electricity cost based on user input for energy consumption during different peak periods. It also applies discounts where eligible and includes taxes in the final calculation.

🎯 Purpose

This program helps users determine their electricity costs based on their energy usage at different times of the day. The calculation includes:
✅ Off-Peak, Mid-Peak, and On-Peak energy rates
✅ Possible discounts for energy consumption and senior citizens
✅ Tax application to compute the final cost

🛠️ How It Works

The user inputs their energy consumption for:
Off-Peak Hours (7 PM - 7 AM)
On-Peak Hours (7 AM - 11 AM & 5 PM - 7 PM)
Mid-Peak Hours (11 AM - 5 PM)
The program calculates the total cost using the following rates:
🟢 Off-Peak Rate: $0.085 per kWh
🔴 On-Peak Rate: $0.176 per kWh
🟡 Mid-Peak Rate: $0.119 per kWh
If eligible, discounts are applied:
Total Usage Discount (4%) if total energy usage is less than 400 kWh
On-Peak Discount (5%) if on-peak usage is less than 150 kWh
Senior Discount (11%) for users who identify as seniors
A 13% tax is applied to the final total.

The program displays the final electricity cost to the user.
